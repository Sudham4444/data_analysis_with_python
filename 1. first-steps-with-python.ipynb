You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n","\n","\n","#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n","\n","To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n","\n",">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Esc+B` to create a new cell. Once a cell is created, click on it to select it. You can then change the cell type to code or markdown (text) using the \"Cell > Cell Type\" menu option. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts `Esc+Y` and `Esc+M`. Double-click a cell to edit the content within the cell. To apply your changes and run a cell, use the \"Cell > Run Cells\" menu option or click the \"Run\" button on the toolbar or just use the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Enter`.
